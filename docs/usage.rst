PKModel software By 4The-right-side Team!   ---------------  
Contributors: Anita Applegarth, Callum Houghton-Flory, 
Edward Wheeler, Nichakorn Pipatpadungsin (Pao).  This is the 
programme that will help you solve ODEs to simulate how pharmacokinetics 
works! Please first check the parameters of the models in models.py to 
ensure this programme runs correctly. This programme will read the number 
of copies of the peripheral compartments, parameters for administering the drug, 
and the initial quantities of drugs inside the body. Parameters associated with 
the patient body (i.e. the model!) are in models.py

For more information on available paramters use the command: `python -m pkmodel -h`
